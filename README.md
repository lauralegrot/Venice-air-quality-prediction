# Venice's air quality prediction
## Final project for Statistical Learning course at UniPD
### Project description
Air pollution poses a significant health risk globally, contributing to approximately 400,000 deaths annually in Europe, with over 50,000 deaths in Italy due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Venice, one of the most polluted cities in Italy, recorded 70 days in 2022 where the PM10 levels exceeded the European regulatory limit of 50 µg/m3, compared to the allowed 35 days. This project focuses on predicting Venice's air quality by analyzing meteorological data and identifying key weather predictors that influence particulate matter (PM10) levels.

Predicting air quality in advance offers significant advantages, particularly for vulnerable groups such as those with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. By identifying critical days of poor air quality, individuals can take protective measures like limiting outdoor exposure and wearing masks. Moreover, traditional methods of monitoring particulate matter require expensive and specialized equipment that is often sparsely distributed. 

The aim of the project is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether the air quality in Venice will exceed the regulatory limit of 50 µg/m³ of PM10 the following day. By leveraging meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the project seeks to provide a more accessible and cost-effective way to forecast air quality without the need for expensive PM10 measurement devices. 

The dataset spans four years (2018,2019,2021 and 2022) and incorporates weather data from the Venice Tessera meteorological station, sourced from the publicly accessible _iLMeteo_ website. Additionally, M10 air quality data was obtained from local monitoring stations through a formal request to ARPA Veneto.
